Git
(Version control and repository management 🔄)

📱 Electronics are my passion! I love taking apart, fixing, and assembling all kinds of devices 🔧, and I understand how they work internally 🛠️. I also have experience building computers for speed ⏱️.

In my free time, I enjoy gaming 🎮, staying active 💪, and I'm a huge volleyball fan 🏐.
